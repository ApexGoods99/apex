# Apex Goods

Apex Goods — "Midnight Luxury" brand scaffolding.

## Mission

Apex Goods crafts premium, design-forward products with an emphasis on sustainability and longevity. We combine modern aesthetics with transparent sourcing and small-batch quality.

## Project structure

- apex-goods/
  - index.html — Mobile-first, semantic single-page landing with inline SVG logo
  - style.css — Midnight Luxury theme using CSS variables and frosted glass UI
  - README.md — This file

## Usage

Open `apex-goods/index.html` in your browser to preview the site.

## Notes for developers

- Theme variables are centralized in `:root` within `style.css` — changing them recolors the site.
- The inline SVG logo is intentionally minimal and uses `currentColor`.
- The contact form is a non-functional skeleton ready to be wired to a backend.
- All sections use semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO.

## Next steps (suggested)

- Hook the contact form to an email/API endpoint.
- Add images and product pages as needed; maintain the CSS variable-driven palette.
- Consider adding small JavaScript enhancements for progressive loading and animations.
